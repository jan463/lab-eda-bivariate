    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Delve into the dynamics of product pricing on Amazon UK to uncover insights that can inform business strategies and decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset**: This lab utilizes the [Amazon UK product dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/uk-optimal-product-price-prediction/)\n",
    "which provides information on product categories, brands, prices, ratings, and more from from Amazon UK. You'll need to download it to start working with it.\n",

    "### Part 1: Analyzing Best-Seller Trends Across Product Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Understand the relationship between product categories and their best-seller status.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Crosstab Analysis**:\n",
    "    - Create a crosstab between the product `category` and the `isBestSeller` status.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Are there categories where being a best-seller is more prevalent? \n",
    "    \t\n",
    "    \t*Hint: one option is to calculate the proportion of best-sellers for each category and then sort the categories based on this proportion in descending order.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Statistical Tests**:\n",
    "    - Conduct a Chi-square test to determine if the best-seller distribution is independent of the product category.\n",
    "    - Compute Cramér's V to understand the strength of association between best-seller status and category.\n",

    "0. **Preliminary Step: Remove outliers in product prices.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\tFor this purpose, we can use the IQR (Interquartile Range) method. Products priced below the first quartile minus 1.5 times the IQR or above the third quartile plus 1.5 times the IQR will be considered outliers and removed from the dataset. The next steps will be done with the dataframe without outliers.\n",

    "3. **Box Plots**:\n",
